# BuildingMyOwnFramework
Building my first framework and github content

I made this framework while studying Application-developer at the Bit Academy in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
Used languages: PHP, HTML, JS(a little bit). Maybe later TailwindCSS.
Used depency packages: Twig and RedbeanPHP.
Technics: request/response, routing, template engines, ORM tools and Inversion of Control (dependency injection).

What i did:
- setting up .htaccess file to make index.php our entry and request point.

- printing Controller and method on the window for knowledge about routing.

- installing Twig with composer, print username through template.

- installing RedbeanPHP with composer, add data using Redbean & display data using Redbean-functions and Twig.

- support each method request, for different actions on the same url.

- login system by making user & session table, securing some pages.

- search each author by id in the third-url method-section.

- ToDo-page where you can add, edit, delete, order and register ToDo's status as done or not done.

To use this code, i commented out some methods to prevent the addMethods to function each refresh.
