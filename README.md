# BuildingMyOwnFramework
Building my first framework and github content

I made this framework while studying Application-developer at the Bit Academy in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
Used languages: PHP, HTML, JS(a little bit). Maybe later TailwindCSS.
Used depency packages: Twig and RedbeanPHP.
Technics: request/response, routing, template engines, ORM tools and Inversion of Control (dependency injection).

1st exercise: setting up .htaccess file to make index.php our entry and request point.

2nd exercise: printing Controller and method on the window.

3rd exercise: installing Twig with composer, print username through template.

4th exercise: installing RedbeanPHP and read the technics carefully, add data using Redbean & display each data using FOR in Twig.

5th exercise: support each method request, for different actions on the same url.

6th exercise: login system by making user & session table. Secure pages.

7th exercise: search each author by id in the url method-section.

Last exercise: ToDo-page where you can add, edit, delete, order and register each ToDo's status as done or not done.

To use this code i commented out some $this->functions to prevent the addfunction to function each refresh.
